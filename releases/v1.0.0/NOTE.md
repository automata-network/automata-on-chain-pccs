- Integrated [RIP-7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md) for cheaper secp256r1 ECDSA verification on supported networks.
 
- Improved data structure encoding:
  - `TCBLevelsObj`
  - `TDXModuleIdentity`
  - `TDXModuleTcbLevelsObj`
 
- Optimized FMSPC TCB parser by reducing unnecessary looping.
 
- Introduced an interface standard for collateral storage known as the **Resolver**. The Resolver is a centralized location for individual DAOs to write and for authorized callers to read collaterals.
 
- Implemented collateral rollback protection:
  - Older (but unexpired) collaterals can no longer replace newer entries.
 
- Each collateral now includes two linked attestations:
  - Tracks the content hash and validity window.
 
- Automatically reverts duplicate collateral upserts.
 
- Event logs are emitted for all state-changing functions.
