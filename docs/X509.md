# X509 (PCK Certificates) Solidity Parser

This document provides an overview and usage details for `X509Helper` and `PCKHelper` contracts. 

`X509Helper` is a base contract facilitates parsing of DER-encoded X509 certificates, extracting relevant fields, and preparing the data for on-chain usage. Whereas, the `PCkHelper` extends the base functionality to extract essential values from the Intel SGX extension, useful for performing Intel DCAP Quote Verification.

## Overview

The `X509Helper` contract is designed to parse a DER-decoded X509 certificate for use in smart contracts. It focuses on certificates that use the ECDSA signature algorithm with the P-256 key curve. The contract leverages several utility libraries for ASN.1 decoding, byte manipulation, and date-time conversion:

- **Asn1Decode:** Provides methods for parsing ASN.1 encoded data.
- **BytesUtils:** Offers helper functions for bytes comparison and slicing.
- **DateTimeUtils:** Converts DER encoded dates into UNIX timestamps.

---

## Limitations

- **ECDSA and P-256 Requirement:** The parser is only valid for certificates using ECDSA with the P-256 curve.
- **Compressed Keys:** The current implementation does not support compressed public keys (with prefix bytes `0x02` or `0x03`).
- **Extension:** An extension must be present. Only key identifiers are parsed; further parsing is required for complete certificate extensions.

## `X509CertObj` Structure

A Solidity structure representing a parsed X509 certificate. Its fields include:

- **serialNumber:** The unique serial number of the certificate.
- **issuerCommonName:** The common name (CN) of the certificate issuer.
- **validityNotBefore:** The start time of the certificate's validity period (as a UNIX timestamp).
- **validityNotAfter:** The end time of the certificate's validity period (as a UNIX timestamp).
- **subjectCommonName:** The common name (CN) of the certificate subject.
- **subjectPublicKey:** The public key of the certificate subject.
- **extensionPtr:** Pointer to certificate extensions (to be parsed further for specific certificates such as PCK).
- **authorityKeyIdentifier:** Identifier for the certificate authority key.
- **subjectKeyIdentifier:** Identifier for the certificate subject key.
- **signature:** Signature for certificate verification.
- **tbs:** "To Be Signed" portion of the certificate data.

## Public Functions

`getTbsAndSig(bytes calldata der) -> (bytes memory tbs, bytes memory sig)`

- **Description:** Extracts the "To Be Signed" (TBS) portion and signature from the DER-encoded certificate.
- **Usage:** Call this function to quickly retrieve both TBS data and the signature needed for signature verification.

`getSerialNumber(bytes calldata der) -> (uint256 serialNum)`

- **Description:** Parses and returns the serial number from the certificate.
- **Usage:** Retrieve the unique serial number which identifies the certificate.

`getIssuerCommonName(bytes calldata der) -> (string memory issuerCommonName)`

- **Description:** Extracts the issuer's common name (CN) from the certificate.
- **Usage:** Useful for validation of the certificate issuer.

`getCertValidity(bytes calldata der) -> (uint256 validityNotBefore, uint256 validityNotAfter)`

- **Description:** Returns the validity period of the certificate.
- **Usage:** Provides the start (`notBefore`) and end (`notAfter`) times of the certificate's valid period, converted to UNIX timestamps.

`getSubjectCommonName(bytes calldata der) -> (string memory subjectCommonName)`

- **Description:** Extracts the subject's common name from the certificate.
- **Usage:** Use to verify the identity of the entity to which the certificate belongs.

`getSubjectPublicKey(bytes calldata der) -> (bytes memory pubKey)`

- **Description:** Retrieves the subjectâ€™s public key from the certificate.
- **Usage:** This public key is used for cryptographic verification. Note that currently only uncompressed public keys (65 bytes with the first byte trimmed) are supported.

`getExtensionPtr(bytes calldata der) -> (uint256 extensionPtr)`

- **Description:** Identifies the pointer to the certificate's extension section.
- **Usage:** Needed when parsing certificate extensions.

`getAuthorityKeyIdentifier(bytes calldata der) -> (bytes memory akid)`

- **Description:** Parses the Authority Key Identifier from the certificate extensions.
- **Usage:** Essential for quickly identifying the issuing CA Certificate. Returns 0x00 if not present.

`getSubjectKeyIdentifier(bytes calldata der) -> (bytes memory skid)`

- **Description:** Retrieves the Subject Key Identifier from the certificate extensions. This field must be present for CA Certificates.
- **Usage:** Typically used for verifying certificate revocation lists (CRLs) without full signature verification; returns 0x00 if not present.

`parseX509DER(bytes calldata der) -> (X509CertObj memory cert)`

- **Description:** Full parsing of the DER-encoded certificate into a structured `X509CertObj`.
- **Usage:** Returns a comprehensive object with all extracted fields from the certificate, including extensions and signature.

---

## Internal Functions

The helper contract also contains several private functions to handle various internal parsing tasks:

- **_parseSerialNumber:** Ensures the serial number is encoded as an integer and converts it.
- **_getCommonName:** Iterates through Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs) to extract the common name.
- **_getValidity:** Converts DER encoded validity fields to UNIX timestamps.
- **_getSubjectPublicKey:** Processes the subject public key, ensuring it is in the uncompressed format.
- **_getAuthorityKeyIdentifier & _getSubjectKeyIdentifier:** Parses key identifiers within the certificate extensions.
- **_getSignature:** Constructs the signature from its two components (r and s).
- **_trimBytes:** Handles padding/truncation of byte arrays.
- **_getExtensionPtr & _findExtensionValuePtr:** Locate extensions in the DER structure.

## PCK Extension

An Intel SGX PCK Certificate must contain the `Intel SGX Extension`, with OID: `1.2.840.113741.1.13.1`.

Once the `PCKHelper` is able to identify the extension, the following objects must be present.

- TCB Values (OID: `1.2.840.113741.1.13.1.2`)
    - which contains the `cpusvn` and `pcesvn` values
- PCEID (OID: `1.2.840.113741.1.13.1.3`)
- FMSPC (OID: `1.2.840.113741.1.13.1.4`)

To extract those values, simply invoke the following method:

`parsePckExtension(bytes memory der, uint256 extensionPtr) -> (uint16 pcesvn, uint8[] memory cpusvns, bytes memory fmspcBytes, bytes memory pceidBytes)`

- **Usage:** The `pceid` and `fmspc` values can be used to fetch collaterals for the given platform to validate the TCB values, ensuring that the platform is running on a version deemed safe by the security policy of the project usecase.
